## Exercise 4: Integrate App Service with the virtual network

Duration: 15 minutes

In this exercise, you Integrate your App Service with the virtual network that was created during the Before the hands-on lab exercises. The ARM template created a Gateway subnet on the VNet, as well as a Virtual Network Gateway. Both of these resources are required to integrate App Service and connect to SQL MI.

### Task 1: Set point-to-site addresses

In this task, you configure the client address pool. This is a range of private IP addresses that you specify below. Clients that connect over a Point-to-Site VPN dynamically receive an IP address from this range. You use a private IP address range that does not overlap with the VNet.

1. Navigate to the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX-vnet-gateway** Virtual network gateway in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) by selecting it from the list of resources in the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group.

2. On the virtual network gateway blade, select **Point-to-site configuration** under Settings in the left-hand menu, and then select **Configure now**.

    ![Point-to-site configuration is highlighted and selected in the left-hand menu. On the Point-to-site configuration blade, Configure now is highlighted.](media/virtual-network-gateway-configure-point-to-site.png "Virtual network gateway")

3. On the **Point-to-site** configuration page, set the following configuration:

    - **Address pool**: Add a private IP address range that you want to use. The address space must be in one of the following address blocks, but should not overlap the address space used by the VNet.
      - `10.0.0.0/8` - This means an IP address range from 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
      - `172.16.0.0/12` - This means an IP address range from 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
      - `192.168.0.0/16` - This means an IP address range from 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255
    - **Tunnel type**: Select **SSTP (SSL)**.
    - **Authentication type**: Choose **Azure certificate**.

4. Select **Save** to validate and save the settings. It takes a few minutes for the save to finish.

### Task 2: Configure VNet integration with App Services

In this task, you add the networking configuration to your App Service to enable communication with resources in the VNet.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Resource groups** from the left-hand menu, select the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group and then select the **tailspintoysUNIQUEID** App Service from the list of resources.

   ![The tailspintoys App Service is highlighted in the list of resource group resources.](media/rg-app-service.png "Resource group")

2. On the App Service blade, select **Networking** from the left-hand menu and then select **Click here to configure** under **VNet Integration**.

    ![On the App Service blade, Networking is selected in the left-hand menu and Click here to configure is highlighted under VNet Integration.](media/app-service-networking.png "App Service")

3. Select **Add VNet** on the VNet Configuration blade.

    ![Add VNet is highlighted on the VNet Configuration blade.](media/app-service-vnet-configuration.png "App Service")

4. Select the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX-vnet** in the Virtual Network dialog.

    ![The hands-on-lab-SUFFIX-vnet** is highlighted.](media/app-service-vnet-configuration-add-vnet.png "App Service")

5. Within a few minutes, the VNet is added, and your App Service is restarted to apply the changes. Select **Refresh** to see the details. You should see that the certificate status is Certificates in sync. **Note**: If the certificate status is not in sync, try hitting refresh, as it can take a moment for that status to be reflected.

    ![The details of the VNet Configuration are displayed. The Certificate Status, Certificates in sync, is highlighted.](media/app-service-vnet-details.png "App Service")

    > **Note**: In you receive a message adding the Virtual Network to Web App failed, select **Disconnect** on the VNet Configuration blade, and repeat steps 3 - 5 above.

### Task 3: Open the web application

In this task, you verify your web application now loads, and you can see the home page of the web app.

1. Select **Overview** in the left-hand menu of your App Service, and select the **URL** of your App service to launch the website. This opens the URL in a browser window.

    ![The App service URL is highlighted.](media/app-service-url.png "App service URL")

2. Verify that the web site and data are loaded correctly. The page should look similar to the following:

    ![Screenshot of the TailspinToys Operations Web App.](media/tailspin-toys-web-app.png "TailspinToys Web")

    > **Note**: If you get an error screen, try selecting Refresh in the browser window.

3. That's it. You successfully connected your application to the new SQL MI database.
