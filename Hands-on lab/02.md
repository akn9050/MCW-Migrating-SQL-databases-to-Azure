## Exercise 2: Migrate the database to SQL MI

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you use the Azure Database Migration Service(DMS) to migrate the `TailspinToys` database from the on-premises SQL 2008 R2 database to SQL MI. Tailspin Toys mentioned the importance of their gamer information web application in driving revenue, so for this migration, the online migration option is used to reduce downtime. The Business Critical service tier is targeted to meet the customer's high-availability requirements.

> The Business Critical service tier is designed for business applications with the highest performance and high-availability (HA) requirements. 
### Task 1: Create an SMB network share on the SqlServer2008 VM

In this task, you create a new SMB network share on the SqlServer2008 VM. This is the folder used by DMS for retrieving backups of the `TailspinToys` database during the database migration process.

1. On the SqlServer2008 VM, open **Windows Explorer** by selecting its icon on the Windows Taskbar.

    ![The Windows Explorer icon is highlighted in the Windows Taskbar.](media/windows-task-bar.png "Windows Taskbar")

2. In the Windows Explorer window, expand **Computer** in the tree view, select **Windows (C:)**, and then select **New folder** in the top menu.

    ![In Windows Explorer, Windows (C:) is selected under Computer in the left-hand tree view, and New folder is highlighted in the top menu.](media/windows-explorer-new-folder.png "Windows Explorer")

3. Name the new folder **dms-backups**, then right-click the folder and select **Share with** and **Specific people** in the context menu.

    ![In Windows Explorer, the context menu for the dms-backups folder is displayed, with Share with and Specific people highlighted.](media/windows-explorer-folder-share-with.png "Windows Explorer")

4. In the File Sharing dialog, ensure the **sqlmiuser** is listed with a **Read/Write** permission level, and then select **Share**.

    ![In the File Sharing dialog, the sqlmiuser is highlighted and assigned a permission level of Read/Write.](media/file-sharing.png "File Sharing")

5. In the **Network discovery and file sharing** dialog, select the default value of **No, make the network that I am connected to a private network**.

    ![In the Network discovery and file sharing dialog, No, make the network that I am connected to a private network is highlighted.](media/network-discovery-and-file-sharing.png "Network discovery and file sharing")

6. Back on the File Sharing dialog, note the path of the shared folder, `\\SQLSERVER2008\dms-backups`, and select **Done** to complete the sharing process.

    ![The Done button is highlighted on the File Sharing dialog.](media/file-sharing-done.png "File Sharing")

### Task 2: Change MSSQLSERVER service to run under sqlmiuser account

In this task, you use the SQL Server Configuration Manager to update the service account used by the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) to the `sqlmiuser` account. This is done to ensure the SQL Server service has the appropriate permissions to write backups to the shared folder.

1. On your SqlServer2008 VM, select the **Start menu**, enter ```sql configuration``` into the search bar, and then select **SQL Server Configuration Managed** from the search results.

    ![In the Windows Start menu, "sql configuration" is entered into the search box, and SQL Server Configuration Manager is highlighted in the search results.](media/windows-start-sql-configuration-manager.png "Windows search")

    > **Note**: Be sure to choose **SQL Server Configuration Manager**, and not **SQL Server 2017 Configuration Manager**, which does not work for the installed SQL Server 2008 R2 database.

2. In the SQL Server Configuration Managed dialog, select **SQL Server Services** from the tree view on the left, then right-click **SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER)** in the list of services and select **Properties** from the context menu.

    ![SQL Server Services is selected and highlighted in the tree view of the SQL Server Configuration Manager. In the Services pane, SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) is selected and highlighted.

3. In the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) Properties dialog, select **This account** under Log on as, and enter the following:

    - **Account name**: ```sqlmiuser```
    - **Password**: ```Password.1234567890```

    ![In the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) Properties dialog, This account is selected under Log on as and the sqlmiuser account name and password are entered.](media/sql-server-service-properties.png "SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) Properties")

4. Select **OK**.

5. Select **Yes** in the Confirm Account Change dialog.

    ![The Yes button is highlighted in the Confirm Account Change dialog.](media/confirm-account-change.png "Confirm Account Change")

6. Observe that the **Log On As** value for the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) service changed to `./sqlmiuser`.

    ![In the list of SQL Server Services, the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) service is highlighted.](media/sql-server-service.png "SQL Server Services")

7. Close the SQL Server Configuration Manager.

### Task 3: Create a backup of TailspinToys database

To perform online data migrations, DMS looks for backups and logs in the SMB shared backup folder on the source database server. In this task, you create a backup of the `TailspinToys` database using SSMS and write it to the `\\SQLSERVER2008\dms-backups` SMB network share you created in a previous task. The backup file needs to include a checksum, so you add that during the backup steps.

1. On the SqlServer2008 VM, open **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17** by entering "sql server" into the search bar in the Windows Start menu.

    ![SQL Server is entered into the Windows Start menu search box, and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17 is highlighted in the search results.](media/start-menu-ssms-17.png "Windows start menu search")

2. In the SSMS **Connect to Server** dialog, enter ```**SQLSERVER2008**``` into the Server name box, ensure **Windows Authentication** is selected, and then select **Connect**.

    ![The SQL Server Connect to Search dialog is displayed, with SQLSERVER2008 entered into the Server name and Windows Authentication selected.](media/sql-server-connect-to-server.png "Connect to Server")

3. Once connected, expand **Databases** under SQLSERVER2008 in the Object Explorer, and then right-click the **TailspinToys** database. In the context menu, select **Tasks** and then **Back Up**.

    ![In the SSMS Object Explorer, the context menu for the TailspinToys database is displayed, with Tasks and Back Up... highlighted.](media/ssms-backup.png "SSMS Backup")

    ![In the migration monitoring window, a status of Log shipping in progress is highlighted.](media/dms-migration-wizard-status-log-files-uploading.png "Migration status")

### Task 7: Perform migration cutover

Since you performed an "online data migration," the migration wizard continuously monitors the SMB network share for newly added log backup files. This allows for any updates that happen on the source database to be captured until you cut over to the SQL MI database. In this task, you add a record to one of the database tables, backup the logs, and complete the migration of the `TailspinToys` database by cutting over to the SQL MI database.

1. In the migration status window in the Azure portal and select **TailspinToys** under database name to view further details about the database migration.

    ![The TailspinToys database name is highlighted in the migration status window.](media/dms-migration-wizard-database-name.png "Migration status")

    ![On the TailspinToys blade, a status of Restored is highlighted next to the TailspinToys.bak file in the list of active backup files.](media/dms-migration-wizard-database-restored.png "Migration Wizard")

3. To demonstrate log shipping and how transactions made on the source database during the migration process are added to the target SQL MI database, you will add a record to one of the database tables.

4. Return to SSMS on your SqlServer2008 VM and select **New Query** from the toolbar.

    ![The New Query button is highlighted in the SSMS toolbar.](media/ssms-new-query.png "SSMS Toolbar")

5. Paste the following SQL script, which inserts a record into the `Game` table, into the new query window:

    ```sql
    USE TailspinToys;
    GO

    INSERT [dbo].[Game] (Title, Description, Rating, IsOnlineMultiplayer)
    VALUES ('Space Adventure', 'Explore the universe with are newest online multiplayer gaming experience. Build custom  rocket ships, and take off for the stars in an infinite open-world adventure.', 'T', 1)
    ```

6. Execute the query by selecting **Execute** in the SSMS toolbar.

    ![The Execute button is highlighted in the SSMS toolbar.](media/ssms-execute.png "SSMS Toolbar")

7. After adding the new record to the `Games` table, back up the transaction logs. DMS detects any new backups and ships them to the migration service. Select **New Query** again in the toolbar, and paste the following script into the new query window:

    ```sql
    USE master;
    GO

    BACKUP LOG TailspinToys
    TO DISK = 'c:\dms-backups\TailspinToysLog.trn'
    WITH CHECKSUM
    GO
    ```

8. Execute the query by selecting **Execute** in the SSMS toolbar.

9. Return to the migration status page in the Azure portal. On the TailspinToys screen, select **Refresh** and you should see the **TailspinToysLog.trn** file appear with a status of **Uploaded**.

    ![On the TailspinToys blade, the Refresh button is highlighted. A status of Uploaded is highlighted next to the TailspinToysLog.trn file in the list of active backup files.](media/dms-migration-wizard-transaction-log-uploaded.png "Migration Wizard")

    >**Note**: If you don't see it the transaction logs entry, continue selecting refresh every few seconds until it appears.

10. Once the transaction logs are uploaded, they are restored to the database. Select **Refresh** every 10-15 seconds until you see the status change to **Restored**, which can take a minute or two.

    ![A status of Restored is highlighted next to the TailspinToysLog.trn file in the list of active backup files.](media/dms-migration-wizard-transaction-log-restored.png "Migration Wizard")

11. After verifying the transaction log status of **Restored**, select **Start Cutover**.

    ![The Start Cutover button is displayed.](media/dms-migration-wizard-start-cutover.png "DMS Migration Wizard")

12. On the Complete cutover dialog, verify pending log backups is `0`, check **Confirm**, and then select **Apply**.

    ![In the Complete cutover dialog, a value of 0 is highlighted next to Pending log backups, and the Confirm checkbox is checked.](media/dms-migration-wizard-complete-cutover-apply.png "Migration Wizard")

13. A progress bar below the Apply button in the Complete cutover dialog provides updates on the status of the cutover. When the migration finishes, the status changes to **Completed**.

    ![A status of Completed is displayed in the Complete cutover dialog.](media/dms-migration-wizard-complete-cutover-completed.png "Migration Wizard")

    > **Note**: If after a few minutes the progress bar has not moved, you can proceed to the next step, and monitor the cutover progress on the TailspinToysMigration blade by selecting refresh.

14. Close the Complete cutover dialog by selecting the "X" in the upper right corner of the dialog, and do the same thing for the TailspinToys blade. This returns you to the TailspinToysMigration blade. Select **Refresh**, and you should see a status of **Completed** from the TailspinToys database.

    ![On the Migration job blade, the status of Completed is highlighted.](media/dms-migration-wizard-status-complete.png "Migration with Completed status")

15. You have successfully migrated the `TailspinToys` database to Azure SQL Managed Instance.
